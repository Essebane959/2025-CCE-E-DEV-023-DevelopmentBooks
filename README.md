# Development Books ‚Äî Spring Boot Kata

A Java **Spring Boot** project that calculates the total price of a shopping basket of software-development books with bundle discounts.  
Built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and exposed through a clean **REST API**.

---

##  About the Kata

This kata is based on *Software Development Books* by St√©phane Genicot.  
The goal is to compute the optimal price when buying different combinations of five well-known books:

1. Clean Code (Robert C. Martin, 2008)
2. The Clean Coder (Robert C. Martin, 2011)
3. Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin, 2017)
4. Test-Driven Development by Example (Kent Beck, 2003)
5. Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Michael C. Feathers, 2004)

Each book costs **‚Ç¨50**, with discounts for distinct titles:

| Different Books | Discount |
|-----------------|-----------|
| 2 | 5 % |
| 3 | 10 % |
| 4 | 20 % |
| 5 | 25 % |
